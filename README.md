**Where Is Wally -- Image Processing Object Recognition**
========================


Introduction
------------------------
This is originally an assignment from Image Processing module -- Where Is Wally. This project aims to locate an object from an image.


Scenario
------------------------
Wally ([Wally.png](Wally.png)) is lost at a Cosplay convention ([Where.jpg](Where.jpg)). Find him.

- Correlation matching would work well here for starters;

- Challenge : Using this method on the full-size image ([WhereLarge.jpg](WhereLarge.jpg)) is painfully slow. See if you can find Wally without using the template image but instead by recognising Wally and his stylish red and white T-shirt. (try colour segmentation then morphology here);


Results
------------------------
| Correlation Matching | Color Segmentation |
| :---: | :---: |
